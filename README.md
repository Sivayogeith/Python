## Measurement Conversion

To convert between units in Python

We need the files
**measure.py, htol.py, ltoh.py, base_unit.py**

Run the file **measure.py** by the command

**For Python Version 3**

> python3 measure.py

**For Python Version 2 and below**

> python measure.py

It will ask some User input:

> Please Enter The First Num: (Ex: 200, 4560)

> Please Enter The Second Num: (Ex: 1425, 1235 )

> Please Enter The First Unit: (Ex: l, kg, g)

> Please Enter The Second Unit: (Ex: ml, g, mg)

Enter it
 
And Boom!

It gives you Answer

*Note : It only works like : 1235 L to mL not 1235 L to Kg ( It was not in my math syllabus )*

## Measurement Add

To Add, Sub, Mul, Div Measurements

We need **operation_measure.py**

**For Python Version 3**

> python3 operation_measure.py

**For Python Version 2 and below**

> python operation_measure.py 

It will ask some User input:

> Please Enter The First Num: (Ex: 200, 4560)

> Please Enter The Operation: (Ex: add, sub, mul, div)
